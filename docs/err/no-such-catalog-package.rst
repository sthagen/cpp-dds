Error: No such package in the catalog
#####################################

This error will occur when one attempts to obtain a package from the package
catalog by its specific ``name@version`` pair, but no such entry exists
in the catalog.

It is possible that the intended package *does exist* but that the spelling of
the package name or version number is incorrect. Firstly, check your spelling
and that the version number you have requested is correct.
